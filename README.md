# Interpretable_ML

### Assignment Summary

In this assignment, you will analyze a telecommunications dataset to understand and predict customer churnâ€”when customers leave for a competitor. The primary goal is to identify factors contributing to churn and to develop interpretable predictive models.

#### Key Tasks:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct an EDA to explore relationships between features and the target variable (churn). Use visualizations and statistical methods to verify model assumptions.
   
2. **Linear Regression**: Model churn as a continuous variable (0 for staying, 1 for churning) using linear regression. Interpret the coefficients and evaluate model performance.

3. **Logistic Regression**: Treat churn as a binary outcome and build a logistic regression model to estimate churn probabilities. Interpret the resulting coefficients.

4. **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**: Develop a GAM to capture non-linear relationships between features and churn. Interpret the findings from this model.

5. **Model Comparison**: Assess and compare the performance and interpretability of the three models. Discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and provide recommendations for the telecommunications company on the most suitable approach for addressing churn.

#### Submission Requirements:
- Submit a link to a GitHub repository containing a Google Colab notebook with well-documented code and explanations for each task. Ensure the notebook follows best practices for documentation and organization.

This assignment emphasizes not only the technical modeling aspects but also the importance of clear communication and documentation in data analysis.


#### NOTE:
For this assignment, I used ChatGPT and CoPilot to help me write up the interpretations of the models.
